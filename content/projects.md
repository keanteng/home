## Geo-based Sustainable Solution
*Nov. - Dec. 2023, Python*

> GitHub: https://github.com/keanteng/datathon

- A geo-based sustainable job solution prototype using Streamlit build using LLM, language model and time series forecasting models.
- The objective of the project is to understand Malaysia's labor market structural issues for resilient and sustainable economic growth. Malaysia remains stuck in a low-wage and low-skill economy because of the work offered domestically, and not because of the talent available. There are also significant skills mismatches between graduates and industry needs.

1. **Where can I check on the raw code that this site used to set up?**
    - You can find it at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/keanteng)
2. **How to post question to you or is there any interactive features such as add to reading list?**
    - If you have any question, you can perhaps use the message feature on Medium. Since the majority of the site traffic comes from there. You can find my articles at my [Medium](https://khorkeanteng.medium.com/) blogs.  
3. **Do you consider adding comment feature to the site?**
    - I will consider adding the feature if requested.

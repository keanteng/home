It's been a while since I last posted where I was juggling with my Japanese language studies and Master program. But I am back and here again, introducing a couple of changes that I made to the blog which I think will be beneficial to the blog site. Of course, I hope I could keep posting more frequently in the future as well.

### New Language Support for Japanese

I have added a new language support for [Japanese](https://keanteng.github.io/home/ja/). I always wanted to do this in the past, but I was not sure how to do it, and I am not very good at Japanese. After studying the language for a while and try to write diary in Japanese for months, I am more confident with the language and plan to write more in Japanese. This is definitely the catalyst to my decision to add Japanese support to the blog. For newer posts that is 2024 and above, multilanguage support will be added, where you can switch between English and Japanese (try with this post). However for older posts, the translation will be put on hold for now. 

### Embedded Media Content

As no external database is used to host media content, I have decided to only use embedded media content like links, images and videos to save space and also the repository size. This is to ensure that the blog site is lightweight and fast. Currently, all the posts from 2024 and above had been revised to use embedded media content. For older posts, I will try to revise them in the future.

### Latex Support

I also added Latex support to the blog in case I need to display math equations. 

That's all for the updates. I hope you enjoy the new features and I will try to post more frequently in the future. Thank you for your support and see you next time!

The first long strip comics I read is Solo Leveling by Chugong and little do I know that while I have read webcomics from Japan, China and United States, Korea is the first country that creates this new form of "manhwa" that has been one of the major cultural forms representing Korean youth culture by utilizing major characteristics of digital technologies. 


In the paper, the following topics are being discussed:
- The ways webtoons become one of the Korea's signature forms of youth culture
- Does webtoons act as one of the major sources for transmedia storytelling?
- Does webtoons utilizing transmedia storytelling take a major role as the primary cultural product of the Korean wave in the global cultural market in the 2010s?

## Media Convergence as A Form of Transmedia Storytelling
Media convergence refers to the merging of different types of mass media like traditional media, print media, broadcast media, new media and the internet. In early twenty-first century, it is the most significant norms in the cultural industries as cultural products have developed and been applied in areas such as growing cultural exchanges and digital technologies production.

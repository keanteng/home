We will perform web scraping on the i3 Investor site.\nImages from Unsplash\nGenerate Webpage for Scraping First of all, open a new google sheet and create a table like this:\nCreate a table like this\nInside the table, we have a few companies name and their listed code. Notice that in cell C3, we put a link — this link will serve as a “prefix”. If the stock code is put at the back of the link, it will direct to the webpage of the particular page.\nprefix link: https://klse.i3investor.com/web/stock/overview/ link to webpage: https://klse.i3investor.com/web/stock/overview/1023 Now, we use the concatenate function to append the code to the prefix links for all the companies in the table:\nUse CONCAT() function to create the links\nWeb Scraping in Action Before we start web scraping, we need to learn about this function — IMPORTXML().\n=importxml(\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;query\u0026#34;) Notice that we already have all the URLs needed as we have created the links on the table.
